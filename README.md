# Hogwild React App

Welcome to **Hogwild**, a React-based application that showcases a collection of hogs with interactive features like filtering, sorting, hiding, and adding new hogs. This project is a fun and interactive way to practice React concepts.

- Click on a hog tile to view additional details (specialty, weight, greased status, and highest medal achieved).
